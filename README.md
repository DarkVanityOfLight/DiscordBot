# DiscordBot
This is my discord Bot.<br>
You can use it by urself, but u have to create a custom Google Search engine<br>
and create your own App/Bot at discord<br>
Put your credentials in a secret.txt next to the bot.py file.<br>
The File should look like this:<br>
DISCORD_TOKEN<br>
GOOGLE_CSE_ID<br>
GOOGLE_API_TOKEN<br>

If you want some custom weasel pictures put them into wiesel/ they have to be .jpg<br>
The bot will take care of all other files.<br>

This Programm uses Pipenv, so make sure to install that.<br>
After that go to the DiscordBot directory and run:

`pipenv install`

After the installation to run the bot:

`pipenv run python bot.py`
